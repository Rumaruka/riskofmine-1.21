Methadone, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol, a variety of opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines... the list just goes on and on and on.\n\nRadical Drinks is insisting that NONE of those were from their energy drink - which I find pretty uh, unlikely. Maybe they REALLY know how to party in Violet Heights, huh?",

Assigning generic tokens.\n\n[Fire crackling]\n\nMAN 1: D-do you think they\u0027re gonna come for us?\n\nMAN 2: They\u0027ll try. It\u0027s going to be a very long while.\n\nMAN 1: What? Why?\n\nMAN 2: A long while. Even if they know where to look we\u0027d be months out from the nearest port. And that\u0027s if they even have any ships as fast as ours – FTL ships are very rare nowadays.\n\nMAN 1: Months...?! And what do you mean if they know where? What about the other ships on our shipping routes?\n\nMAN 2: We weren\u0027t on the route.\n\n[Fire pops]\n\nMAN 1: What?!\n\nMAN 2: We should\u0027ve been halfway to Procyon by the time we crashed... but we weren’t. The ship never announced it was slowing down either, so that’ll make triangulating our positions even harder.\n\nMAN 1: I-I don\u0027t get it. Who would take a UES train off course? That\u0027s completely insane!\n\nMAN 2: I don’t know – only the Captain does. There’s no reason to slow down in this star system - there\u0027s not even supposed to be a habitable planet out here.\n\n[Sizzling]\n\nMAN 2: This looks cooked to me. Can\u0027t vouch for how it\u0027ll taste - but we have to eat.\n\nMAN 1: I... I can\u0027t even think right now. I’m not hungry.\n\nMAN 2: Eat. We\u0027ve got a lot of traveling to do tomorrow and we\u0027ll need to keep our strength.\n\nMAN 1: Sure. Okay. Okay. Um… do you think it\u0027s poisonous?\n\nMAN 2: Eat.\n\nEnd of requested transcript. ",

Drive, Yustik Plaza, Mercury\nShipping Details:\n\nWeren\u0027t you just a kid? Summer break feels like it was just so recent - but it\u0027s been 10 years, hasn\u0027t it? Life moves faster and faster as you get older - less moments to remember, to cement you in time. I don\u0027t even remember being 25. How did I forget an entire year?\n\nAnyways - I found this in a trinket shop on Mercury. A chronobauble - the seller said something about special relativity, real heavy distortions or something - I didn\u0027t really get it. It\u0027s supposed to slow down time around it. Right.\n\nAnyways, I\u0027m shipping this to myself - to arrive in 10 years. A gift, from me to me. A reminder to make memories, to slow down a bit. 10 years will pass so quick - try to remember them! You\u0027ve got to put effort in life!",
